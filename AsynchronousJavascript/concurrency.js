// Concurrency

// It means that an application is making a progress on more than one task - seemingly at the same time 
// Since a CPU can execute one task at  a time thus it will interchange in a matter of mill second

// Parallel Execution

// making progress on one or more tasks at the exact same time
// Maybe if you are having a computer with two or more cpus each working on one task

// Parrallel Concurrent Execution

// Multiple Processors and all perfomin the conncurrency

// Parallelism

// spliting more than one task into subtasks which can be executed in parallel
// All as they are on different cpu's they are all being executed concurrently
